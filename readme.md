#Matching card game 

This project designed to explore the following SwiftUI features and patterns:
* `PreferenceKey` both for sizing and to update animations
* `AnimatableModifier` for a variety of custom animations
* `UIViewRepresentable` to make use of SpriteKit particles in SwiftUI
* A stream of sequential animatable transactions, allowing thew view to decide the timing and nature of the animations while keeping the state updates in the viewModel.
